# Research Lessons Learned

- Verify that every cited link resolves and contributes real content before publishing (e.g., the prior reference to `cloud.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/overview` returned 404 and should have been omitted or replaced).
- Only document sources that provided useful information; skip mentions of unsuccessful searches or dead ends.
- Do not include HTTP status codes or other transport details in user-facing research summaries—focus on the insights.
- When documentation is sparse (such as Gemini Code Assist CLI guidance), pair official product pages with blog or release notes that actually describe behavior, and clearly state any remaining unknowns.
