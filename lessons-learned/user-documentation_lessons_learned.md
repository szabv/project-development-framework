# User Documentation Lessons Learned

- Focus on the subject matter; avoid meta notes about how or why the document exists.
- Lead with purpose and audience so readers know when to use the doc.
- Keep structure predictable: short intro, key sections, references/links.
- Prefer concrete, actionable guidance over abstract principles.
- Keep language concise; avoid redundancy and filler.
- Update examples when underlying tools or workflows change; date noteworthy updates.
