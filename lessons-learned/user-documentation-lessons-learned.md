# User Documentation Lessons Learned

- Focus on the subject matter; avoid meta notes about how or why the document exists (e.g., skip openings like “This document is human-readable and shared…”).
- Do not narrate exclusions—if something is out of scope (e.g., a tool removed from consideration), omit it without adding commentary such as “Cursor/ArCursor excluded per latest guidance.”
- Lead with purpose and audience so readers know when to use the doc.
- Keep structure predictable: short intro, key sections, references/links.
- Prefer concrete, actionable guidance over abstract principles.
- Keep language concise; avoid redundancy and filler.
- Update examples when underlying tools or workflows change; date noteworthy updates.
